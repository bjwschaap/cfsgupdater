# cfsgupdater

Lambda that updates SGs with ingress only for current Cloudfront IPs

This is a Go port/adaptation of an AWS Sample lambda. See:
[update_security_groups_lambda](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cloudfront-samples/tree/master/update_security_groups_lambda)

You should easily be able to adjust this example to fit your own needs.
